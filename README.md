# The first XACLE challenge dataset

## Contents

This dataset consists of the following componets:

- Audio–text pairs

	This dataset includes 7,500 audio–text pairs for training and 3,000 audio–text pairs for validation.
	Each text is written in English.
	All audio samples was converted to mono 16-bit 16 kHz format.

- 11-point semantic-alignment scores between audio and text (per listener)

	This dataset includes subjective evaluation scores for semantic alignment between audio and text.
	The semantic-alignment score is on a an 11-point scale from 0 ("does not match at all") to 10 ("matched exactly").
	Each audio–text pair is evaluated by four native English-speaking .

- Average semantic-alignment scores
	
	This dataset includes average semantic-alignment scores for each audio–text pair.

- Listener IDs

	This dataset includes listener IDs of those who scored the semantic alignment between audio and text.
